Guide to connect battery to battery protection board.

**What you will need before you start***

Solder
Soldering Iron
2 HXT cables
22 gauge wire(red,white,black)
Female JST-XH connector
Wire Strippers
Zippy Compact 4000 Mah Battery
20A 7.4V Battery Protection Board
Volt Meter
Electrical Tape

**Step 1: Make Cables ***

Solder red,black,white wires to JST-XH female connector so that the 
connector will line up with the connector from the battery.

Cut two HXT cables so its just the connector plug and two wires (red & black coming out).

**Step 2: Solder Cables to Board ***

Solder HXT connector ground cable(black wire) to P- pad on PCB.
Solder HXT power cable(red wire) to P+ pad on PCB.
Solder HXT connector ground cable(black wire) to B- pad on PCB.
Solder HXT power cable(red wire) to B+ pad on PCB.
Solder JST-XH power cable(red wire) to B+ pad on PCB.
Solder JST-XH current sense cable(white wire) to COM pad on PCB.
Solder JST-XH ground cable(black wire) to B- pad on PCB.

** Step 3: Connect battery to board ***

Plug in HXT connector from B+ & B- to battery connector.
Plug in JST-XH connector from PCB board to battery JST-XH.


** Step 4: Test ***

Take reading from B+/B- pads. Should be 7.4V
Take reading from COM pad, Should be one cell of battery, roughly 3.7V
Take reading from P+/P- pads. Should be 7.4V

** Step 5: Precaution *** 

Tape off pads and all wires with electrical tape until needed.
